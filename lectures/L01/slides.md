# Core Concepts of Generative AI

</div>

<!--s-->

## Core Concepts | Generative vs Discriminative Models

### Generative Models

Estimate distribution $p(x)$.

### Discriminative Models

Estimate the conditional probability distribution $p(y|x)$.

<!--s-->

## Core Concepts | Hello, World! 

Let's create a very simple generative model. Here we will generate a set of points $X$ from a distribution $p_{data}$.

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

Our task is to choose a different point $x = (x_1, x_2)$ from the distribution $p_{data}$ Where would you place the point $x$?

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

<div style='text-align: center;'>

   <p style='font-size: 0.6em; color: grey;'>Foster 2023</p>
</div>


</div>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Core Concepts | Intuition

The point $x$ should be placed in the region where the density of $p_{data}$ is high. We did this by creating a mental model which we can call $p_{model}$ that approximates $p_{data}$. The goal of generative modeling is to learn the distribution $p_{model}$ that best approximates $p_{data}$.

<div style='text-align: center;'>
   <img src='https://storage.googleapis.com/slide_assets/genai_intro/known_bounds.png' style='border-radius: 10px;'>
   <p style='font-size: 0.6em; color: grey;'>Foster 2023</p>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Core Concepts | Generative Modeling Framework

- We have a dataset $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$ drawn from an unknown distribution $p_{data}$.
- We want to build a model $p_{model}$ that approximates $p_{data}$.
- We can then sample from $p_{model}$ to generate new data points.

<div style='text-align: center;'>
   <img src='https://storage.googleapis.com/slide_assets/genai_intro/known_bounds.png' style='border-radius: 10px;'>
   <p style='font-size: 0.6em; color: grey;'>Foster 2023</p>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Core Concepts | Desired Properties of $p_{model}$

### Accuracy
If $p_{model}$ is close to $p_{data}$, then it should be able to generate data points that look like they were drawn from $p_{data}$

### Generation
It should be possible to generate new data points from $p_{model}$

### Representation
It should be possible to understand how different high-level features of the data are represented in $p_{model}$

<!--s-->

## Core Concepts | Generative Modeling

Here, we can see that the distribution $p_{model}$ is not the same as the true distribution $p_{data}$. In fact, it is a very poor representation. The goal of generative modeling is to learn a model $p_{model}$ that is as close to the true distribution $p_{data}$ as possible.

   <p style='font-size: 0.6em; color: grey;'>Foster 2023</p>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Core Concepts | Representation Learning
 
Representation learning is the process of learning a representation of the data that makes it easier to extract useful information when building models.

Latent space $z$ is a lower-dimensional representation of the data $x$. The goal is to learn a mapping from $x$ to $z$ that captures the underlying structure of the data with:

$$f(x) = z$$

<!--s-->

## Core Concepts | Tin Latent Space

For example, here is a small dataset of tins. How many latent features do you need to describe a tin?

<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

## Core Concepts | Tin Latent Space

The latent space $z$ is a lower-dimensional representation of the data $x$. The goal is to learn a mapping from $x$ to $z$ that captures the underlying structure of the data with $f(x) = z$.

# Probability Theory

</div>

<!--s-->

## Probability Theory | Sample Space

The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

<div style='text-align: center;'>

   <p style='font-size: 0.6em; color: grey;'>Foster 2023</p>
</div>


<!--s-->

## Probability Theory | Probability Distribution

A function $p$ that represents the relative likelihood of each outcome in the sample space. The integral of $p$ over the sample space is 1.

</div>

<!--s-->

## Probability Theory | Parametric Modeling

A technique that we can use to structure our approach to finishing $p_{model}$. A parametric model is a family of density functions $p_{\theta}(x)$, where $\theta$ is a set of parameters that we can tune to make $p_{\theta}(x)$ more closely approximate $p_{data}$.

   <img src='https://dr282zn36sxxg.cloudfront.net/datastreams/f-d%3A6bccc5fee65fe0531a06d03e7092fc98b59b1482ee5b74b480c81067%2BIMAGE_TINY%2BIMAGE_TINY.1' style='border-radius: 10px; width: 50%;'>
   <p style='font-size: 0.6em; color: grey;'>ck12 2025</p>
</div>


<!--s-->

## Probability Theory | Likelihood

The likelihood of a set of parameters $L(\theta | X)$ is the probability of observing the data $X$ given the parameters $\theta$. It is defined as $L(\theta | X) = p_{\theta}(X)$.

That is, the likelihood of $\theta$ given a point $x$ is $p_{\theta}(x)$. Given i.i.d., if we have a whole dataset $X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}$, then the likelihood of $\theta$ given the dataset is $p_{\theta}(X) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{\theta}(x_i)$.

The goal of training a generative model is to find the parameters $\theta$ that maximize the likelihood of the data. The log-likelihood is often used instead of the likelihood because it is easier to work with. The log-likelihood is defined as $\log p_{\theta}(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \log p_{\theta}(x_i)$.

<!--s-->

## Probability Theory | Subtle Note on Likelihood

The likelihood is a function of the parameters and not the data. It should not be intrepreted as the probability that a given parameter set is **correct**, but rather that the data is **likely** given the parameter set.

<!--s-->

## Probability Theory | Maximum Likelihood Estimation

Maximum likelihood estimation is the technique that allows us to estimate $\widehat{\theta}$ -- the set of parameters $\theta$ that is most likely to explain some observed data X. Formally in terms of likelihood, we can write this as:

$$ \widehat{\theta} = \arg \max_{\theta} p_{\theta}(X) $$

$\widehat{\theta}$ is also called the maximum likelihood estimate. In the world map example, the MLE is the smallest rectangle that still contains all of the points in the training set. Since neural networks typically minimize a loss function, we can also think of MLE as minimizing the negative log-likelihood:

$$ \widehat{\theta} = \arg \min_{\theta} -\log p_{\theta}(X) $$

Generative modeling can be considered to be a form of MLE, where the parameters $\theta$ are learned to maximize the likelihood of the data.

# Tools and Platforms

</div>

<!--s-->

## Tools and Platforms

Generative AI is a rapidly evolving field, and often you're most limited by your ability to **scale**. For that reason, let's cover some of the tools and platforms that we'll be using in this course.

### Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a platform that allows you to develop, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and efficient, making them ideal for running computationally intensive tasks like training deep learning models.

### QUEST

[Quest](https://www.it.northwestern.edu/departments/it-services-support/research/computing/quest/) is Northwestern's high-performance computing cluster. It is a shared resource that is available to all Northwestern researchers. It is a great resource for running computationally intensive tasks, such as training deep learning models. We can run **slurm** jobs on Quest to train our models, and our jobs will run inside Docker containers.

> <span style="font-style: normal;"> Vocabulary will be placed in boxes. </span>

<!--s-->

## Why Containerization?

A **container** is a lightweight, portable, and efficient way to package applications and their dependencies. Containers isolate applications from the host system and other containers, making them easier to deploy and manage.

| **Container** | **Virtual Machine** |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Lightweight | Heavyweight |
| Faster startup | Slower startup |
| Less resource usage | More resource usage |
| Shared kernel | Separate kernel |

> <span style="font-style: normal;"> The **kernel** is the core of an operating system that manages system resources. </span>

> <span style="font-style: normal;"> **Virtual machines** are software emulations of physical computers that run an operating system and applications. </span>

<!--s-->

## What is Docker and Why is it Useful?

**Docker** is an open-source platform designed to simplify the process of creating, deploying, and running applications. You can think of Docker as a self-contained package that includes everything an application needs to run: the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. 

This package is called a **image**. When you run an image, it creates a **container**, an isolated environment that runs the application.

> <span style="font-style: normal;">An **image** is a snapshot of an application and its dependencies. </span>

> <span style="font-style: normal;">A **container** is a running instance of an image. </span>

<!--s-->

## Benefits of Using Docker

1. Consistency Across Environments

2. Efficiency

3. Scalability

4. Isolation and Security

<!--s-->

## Benefits of Using Docker | Consistency

<div class = "col-wrapper" style = "height: 70%;">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%;">

Docker ensures that software behaves the same on every machine. Developers can be confident that applications that work on their computers will work in production.

Docker containers are typically based on a Linux distribution, which provides a consistent environment for applications.

<!--s-->

## Benefits of Using Docker | Efficiency


Containers share the host's operating system kernel, which makes them more lightweight and efficient than traditional virtual machines.

This results in faster application delivery, reduced resource consumption, and lower overhead.

## Benefits of Using Docker | Scalability

Docker makes it easy to scale applications horizontally by adding more containers. This supports modern cloud-native development practices.

Containers can be easily replicated and distributed across multiple hosts, providing flexibility and scalability.

</div>

<!--s-->

## Docker Architecture | Daemon

The **Docker Daemon** (`dockerd`) is the heart of Docker, responsible for running containers on a host. It listens for API requests and manages Docker objects (images, containers, networks, etc.).

<div class = "col-wrapper">

<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/0*G82uZfX0ozIih3-_" height="50%" style = "border-radius: 10px;">

<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

> <span style="font-style: normal;"> A **daemon** is a background process that runs continuously, waiting for requests to process. </span>

</div>

</div>


<!--s-->

## Docker Architecture | Client

The **Docker Client** is a command-line tool (CLI) used by the user to interact with the Docker daemon. 

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

Common CLI commands include <span class="code-span">docker pull</span>, <span class="code-span">docker build</span>, and <span class="code-span">docker run</span>. The client sends commands to the daemon, which executes them on the host.

<!--s-->

## Docker Architecture | Images

**Docker Images** are immutable, read-only templates used to create containers.

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

An image might include an OS, application code, and dependencies required to run an application. Images are built from a series of layers. Each layer represents a modification to the previous layer, allowing for efficient storage and distribution of images.

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

</div>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Docker Architecture | Containers

**Docker Containers** are running instances of Docker images.

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

They can be started, stopped, moved, or deleted using Docker commands. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, but they share the host OS's kernel. This makes them lightweight and efficient.

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 0.6em; color: grey;">NordicAPIs</p>

</div>
</div>

<!--s-->

## Docker Architecture | Registries

**Docker Registries** store Docker images. A popular public registry is Docker Hub, but private registries can also be used. Docker images can be pushed to and pulled from registries, allowing for easy distribution and sharing of images.

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

Other examples of registries include:

- **Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**
- **Google Container Registry (GCR)**
- **Azure Container Registry (ACR)**

### Namespaces and Control Groups
Docker uses Linux namespaces to provide isolation for containers and control groups (cgroups) to limit resource usage.

### Union File System
Layers are used to create Docker images. Each layer is a modification over the previous one, which allows efficient storage and reduced bandwidth usage when distributing an image. A Union File System (UFS) combines these layers into a single view (union) of the file system.

## Using Docker

1. Installing Docker
2. Building from a Dockerfile
3. Running Containers

<!--s-->

## Using Docker | Installing Docker

To start using Docker, you need to install the Docker Engine on your machine. It can be downloaded from the Docker website and is available for various operating systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Download Docker Desktop: [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Using Docker | Building a Dockerfile

<div class = "col-wrapper">
<div class="c1" style = "width: 50%">

A **Dockerfile** is a text document that contains all the commands needed to assemble a Docker **image**. It starts with a <span class="code-span">FROM</span> instruction that specifies the base image. 


Usually, it also includes commands like <span class="code-span">WORKDIR</span>, <span class="code-span">COPY</span>, <span class="code-span">RUN</span>, and <span class="code-span">CMD</span> to set up the environment and run the application.

</div>
<div class="c2" style = "width: 50%">

```dockerfile

# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image.
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set the working directory.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app.
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt.
# RUN is used to execute commands during the build process.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Start the application. CMD specifies the command to run when the container starts.
CMD ["python", "app.py"]

```

## Docker | Deep Learning Container

Let's take a look at a simple Dockerfile for a TensorFlow container. This container is based on the official TensorFlow image and includes some common libraries for deep learning.

```dockerfile

# Use the official TensorFlow image as a base image.
FROM tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu

# Set the working directory.
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app (a requirements.txt file).
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt.
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Install vscode server.
RUN curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | bash

# Add code-server to PATH
ENV PATH="/root/.local/bin:${PATH}"

# Expose the port that the server is running on.
EXPOSE 8080

# Run the code-server command when the container starts.
CMD ["code-server", "--auth", "none", "--bind-addr", "0.0.0.0:8080", "."]
```

## What is QUEST?

**QUEST** is Northwestern's high-performance computing cluster. It is a shared resource that is available to all Northwestern researchers. We have been given an allocation on QUEST to run computationally intensive tasks, such as training deep generative models.

<!--s-->

## Why Use QUEST?

QUEST provides several benefits for running computationally intensive tasks:

1. **High Performance**: QUEST is designed to handle large-scale computations efficiently.
2. **Resource Sharing**: QUEST is a shared resource, allowing multiple users to run jobs simultaneously.
3. **Job Scheduling**: QUEST uses the **slurm** job scheduler to manage job submissions and resource allocation. 🔥
4. **Singularity Containers**: QUEST supports Singularity containers, which allow you to run applications in isolated environments. Note: Docker containers are easily & automatically converted to Singularity containers on Quest.

Most importantly, getting used to running your training jobs in containers on a high-performance computing cluster is a valuable skill that will serve you well in your research and industry careers.

<!--s-->

## Accessing QUEST

QUEST is best accessed via SSH. SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows you to securely connect to a remote computer. You can use an SSH client to connect to QUEST from your local machine.

To access QUEST, you will need to use your NetID and password. You can access QUEST from any computer with an internet connection.

```bash
ssh -X <netid>@login2.quest.northwestern.edu
```

<!--s-->

## Running Jobs on QUEST

To run a job on QUEST, you will need to:

1. Write a <span class="code-span">slurm script</span> that specifies the job requirements.
2. Submit the job using the <span class="code-span">sbatch</span> command.
3. Monitor the job using the <span class="code-span">squeue</span> command.

The <span class="code-span">slurm script</span> specifies the resources required for the job, such as the number of CPUs, memory, and runtime. The <span class="code-span">sbatch</span> command submits the job to the slurm scheduler, which allocates the necessary resources and runs the job.

<!--s-->

## QUEST | Hello, World! Example

The below script <span class="code-span">run.py</span> is a simple Python script that prints some information about the environment, such as the current working directory, time, TensorFlow version, and the number of GPUs available.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import logging
import os
import datetime

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    logging.info("Hello World")
    logging.info("Current working directory: {}".format(os.getcwd()))
    logging.info("Current time: {}".format(datetime.datetime.now()))
    logging.info("TensorFlow version: {}".format(tf.__version__))
    logging.info("Num GPUs Available: {}".format(len(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))))
    logging.info("Num GPUs Available: {}".format(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
    logging.info("Num GPUs Available: {}".format(tf.config.list_logical_devices('GPU')))
```
<!--s-->

## QUEST | Slurm Script Example

Let's run the <span class="code-span">run.py</span> script on QUEST using a slurm script named <span class="code-span">jobscript.sh</span>. Here is an example of a slurm script that specifies the resources required for a job:

```bash

#!/bin/sh
#SBATCH --account=p32562
#SBATCH --partition=gengpu
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:a100:1
#SBATCH --time=00:10:00 
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=1
#SBATCH --mem=20G
#SBATCH --output=/projects/p32562/gpu-check.log

module purge
eval "$(conda shell.bash hook)"
conda activate /home/sil3812/.conda/envs/genai

python run.py

```

This script requests a single GPU, 10 minutes of runtime, 20GB of memory, and specifies the output file for the job. It then activates a conda environment and runs the <span class="code-span">run.py</span> script. Note: The conda environment is pre-installed under my profile on QUEST. You can do the same via your head node.

<!--s-->

## QUEST | Running a Job

To submit a job on QUEST, you can use the <span class="code-span">sbatch</span> command with the <span class="code-span">slurm script</span> as an argument:

```bash
sbatch jobscript.sh
```

This command submits the job to the slurm scheduler, which allocates the necessary resources and runs the job. You can monitor the job using the <span class="code-span">squeue</span> command.

<!--s-->

## QUEST | Monitoring a Job

To monitor a job on QUEST, you can use the <span class="code-span">squeue</span> command:

```bash
squeue -u your_netid
```

This command displays information about the jobs you have submitted, including the job ID, name, status, and runtime. You can use this information to track the progress of your job and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
