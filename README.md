# MSAI XX Generative AI

Welcome to the MSAI XX Generative AI course! This course is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of generative AI techniques, with a focus on image and text generation. The course will cover foundational knowledge, autoencoders, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, autoregressive models, and multi-modal models. The course will also include hands-on projects and demonstrations to reinforce the concepts learned.

** NOTE FOR QUEST: This course is designed to be run in low resource environments (2 CPU / 8 GB RAM). I don't anticipate extensive usage of GPUs and will provide alternatives for GPU-heavy tasks.  **

## Comprehension Quizzes

Comprehension quizzes will take place during lecture to ensure you are following along and attending lectures. These will be graded, and the lowest n scores will be dropped. 

------

## Projects

The course will have two projects, each focusing on a different aspect of generative AI. The first project will focus on image generation, while the second project will focus on text generation.

### Baseline Project Criteria

Meeting the basic project criteria will result in a maximum grade of 85% for the project. Details on the baseline project criteria will be provided in the project description.

### Extra Project Criteria

Meeting the additional extra project criteria will result in a maximum grade of 100% for the project. Details on the extra project criteria will be provided in the project description.

### Project Part I (Exhibit)

The first project will focus on image generation. You will be required to generate images using a generative model of your choice. You will create a virtual art exhibit and host it online.

### Project Part II (Chatbot)

The second project will focus on text generation, but with the additional option to be multimodal. You will create a chatbot and host it online.
