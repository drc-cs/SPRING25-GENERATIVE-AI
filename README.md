# MSAI XX Generative AI

Welcome to the MSAI XX Generative AI course! This course is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of generative AI techniques, with a focus on image and text generation. The course will cover foundational knowledge, autoencoders, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, autoregressive models, and multi-modal models. The course will also include hands-on projects and demonstrations to reinforce the concepts learned.

## Lecture Breakdown

Lectures will be broken down into theory and a comprehension quiz or demo project time.

| Component | Duration | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lecture | 60 minutes | Theoretical Foundations |
| Quiz OR Project Time | 20 minutes | Application and Practice |
