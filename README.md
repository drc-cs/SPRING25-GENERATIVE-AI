# MSAI 495 Generative AI 
[[github link](https://github.com/drc-cs/SPRING25-GENERATIVE-AI)]

Welcome to Generative AI! This course is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of generative AI techniques, with a focus on image and text generation. We will cover foundational knowledge, autoencoders, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, autoregressive models, and multi-modal models. We will also include hands-on projects and demonstrations to reinforce the concepts learned.

## Grading

There is a high emphasis on the practical application of the concepts covered in this course.

| Component | Weight |
| --- | --- |
| Attendance & Comprehension Quizzes | 20% |
| Project Part I (Image) | 30% |
| Project Part II (Text) | 30% |
| Exam | 20% |

## Grading Scale

| Grade | Percentage |
| --- | --- |
| A | 93-100 |
| A- | 90-92 |
| B+ | 87-89 |
| B | 83-86 |
| B- | 80-82 |
| C+ | 77-79 |
| C | 73-76 |
| C- | 70-72 |

------

## Comprehension Quizzes

Graded quizzes will take place during lecture to ensure you are following along and attending lectures. These will be graded, and the lowest 2 scores will be dropped. 

------

## Projects

The course will have two projects, each focusing on a different aspect of generative AI. The first project will focus on image generation, while the second project will focus on text generation. Both projects will have a proposal, the project, and a final report.

### Baseline Project Criteria

Meeting the basic project criteria will result in a maximum grade of 85% for the project. Details on the baseline project criteria will be provided in the project description, but the following will be evaluated:

1. Code quality
2. Ambition & complexity

### Extra Project Criteria

Meeting the additional extra project criteria will result in a maximum grade of 100% for the project. The following are some high-level ideas for "Extra Project Criteria":

#### Image Generation

1. ML operations
- Distributed preprocessing or training pipelines
- Metrics training & evaluation tracking
2. Hyperparameter tuning strategies
3. Creative latent space exploration
4. Gallery GUI

#### Text Generation

1. Multimodal model
- Text + Image
- Text + Audio
- Text + ??
2. Explainable AI
3. ML operations (must be different from the first project)
4. Chatbot GUI
